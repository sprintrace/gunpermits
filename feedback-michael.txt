abstract: "First sentence. We examine data from the General Social Survey focused on sentiment toward gun permits from 1972 to 2022. We find that initially in our sample there is little difference in sentiment by political affiliation, however by the early 1990s this changes and recently sentiment has become very associated with political affiliation.
