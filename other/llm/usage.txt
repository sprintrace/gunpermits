LLM: copilot.
Date: 18 March 2024


You
help me come up with questions for this prompt. In an appendix, please put together a supplementary survey that could be used to augment the general social survey the paper focuses on. The purpose of the supplementary survey is to gain additional information on the topic that is the focus of the paper, beyond that gathered by the general social survey. The survey would be distributed in the same manner as the general social survey but needs to stand independently. The supplementary survey should be put together using a survey platform. A link to this should be included in the appendix. Additionally, a copy of the survey should be included in the appendix.
Please be sure to discuss ethics and bias, with reference to relevant literature.
Code should be entirely reproducible, well-documented, and readable. My topic is mandatory police issued gun permits for American citizens
Copilot
To create a supplementary survey that stands independently and augments the general social survey, you can consider the following questions:

Demographic Information:
What is your age group?
What is your gender?
What is your occupation?
In which state do you currently reside?
General Opinion on Gun Permits:
Do you believe that owning a gun is a fundamental right for American citizens?
Should police-issued gun permits be mandatory for owning a firearm?
Safety and Regulation:
How safe do you feel knowing that citizens around you may be carrying firearms?
What level of background check do you think is appropriate for issuing a gun permit?
Training and Education:
Should mandatory training and education be required for all gun permit applicants?
How often should firearm training be updated or renewed?
Impact on Law Enforcement:
How do you think mandatory police-issued gun permits would impact law enforcement practices?
Should law enforcement have access to a database of all gun permit holders?
Ethical Considerations:
How can bias be minimized in the process of issuing gun permits?
What ethical considerations should be taken into account when designing policies around gun permits?
Personal Experience:
Have you or someone you know ever applied for a gun permit?
What was the experience like, and do you have any suggestions for improvement?
Ethics and Bias Discussion: When discussing ethics and bias, itâ€™s important to ensure that the survey is designed to protect the confidentiality and anonymity of the respondents12. Questions should be neutral and avoid leading language to prevent introducing bias into the survey results3. Additionally, the survey should be accessible to a diverse population to avoid selection bias4.

Code Documentation: For the code to be reproducible, well-documented, and readable, it should include clear comments explaining the purpose of each section of code, the expected inputs and outputs, and any dependencies or libraries used5. Version control systems like Git can be used to track changes and collaborate with others6.

Appendix: The appendix would contain a link to the survey platform where the survey is hosted, as well as a copy of the survey for reference. It would also include a section on the ethical considerations and literature references used in designing the survey and the code documentation practices followed.

Remember to seek approval from an ethical review board or committee if required, and ensure that all research practices adhere to established ethical standards.
